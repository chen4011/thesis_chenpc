abstract = {The many epidemics that the world is witnessing necessitate the use of telehealth. Developing a website for telerehabilitation follow-up is appealing. Furthermore, the patient benefits financially from the elimination of costly equipment. The major purpose of this paper is to present a telerehabilitation website and to compare an artificial intelligence technique incorporated into the website called MediaPipe to measure range of motion with a universal goniometer and a digital angle ruler. Data was collected from around 50 healthy volunteers with the assistance of physical therapists. The MediaPipe-based shoulder measurement systemâ€™s reliability is determined. To validate the approach, the 95% limits of agreement and mean difference between the MediaPipe and the two other devices are determined. The results indicate that the MediaPipe is reliable and valid for use in telerehabilitation with the studied movements. The method is then used to monitor a patient with a right patella fracture.}

  abstract       = {Motion tracking based on commercial inertial measurements units (IMUs) has been widely studied in the latter years as it is a cost-effective enabling technology for those applications in which motion tracking based on optical technologies is unsuitable. This measurement method has a high impact in human performance assessment and human-robot interaction. IMU motion tracking systems are indeed self-contained and wearable, allowing for long-lasting tracking of the user motion in situated environments. After a survey on IMU-based human tracking, five techniques for motion reconstruction were selected and compared to reconstruct a human arm motion. IMU based estimation was matched against motion tracking based on the Vicon marker-based motion tracking system considered as ground truth. Results show that all but one of the selected models perform similarly (about 35 mm average position estimation error).},
